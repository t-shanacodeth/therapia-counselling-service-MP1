				What is psychotherapy?
			</h2>
			<br>
			<p>
				Psychotherapy, often referred to as 'talk therapy', is a collaborative treatment designed to help individuals understand and manage emotional, psychological, and behavioral challenges. 
				Through regular sessions, clients work with a trained therapist to explore their thoughts, feelings, and patterns of behavior in a safe, confidential setting.
				<br>
				<br>
				The goal of psychotherapy is to help clients gain insight into their problems, develop healthier coping strategies, 
				and improve their overall well-being. Depending on individual needs various therapeutic approaches may be used, such as: cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), 
				psychodynamic therapy, or person-centered therapy. 
				Psychotherapy can be effective for addressing issues like anxiety, depression, trauma, relationship difficulties, and stress.
				<br>
				<br>
				By fostering self-awareness and offering guidance, psychotherapy supports personal growth, emotional healing, and positive life changes.

				Modalities
			</h2>
			<br>
			<section>
				<h3>
					PERSON-CENTRED THERAPY
				</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Person-centred therapy is a non-directive, empathetic approach that empowers clients 
					to explore their thoughts and emotions in a safe, supportive environment. 
					By offering empathy, authenticity, and unconditional positive regard, 
					the therapist helps clients access their own strengths, fostering self-discovery, personal growth, 
					and emotional healing. This approach is ideal for those seeking greater self-awareness and improved well-being.
				</p>
			</section>
			<br>
			<section>
				<h3>
					EXISTENTIAL THERAPY
				</h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					Existential therapy is a philosophical approach to counselling that focuses on exploring life’s fundamental questions, 
					such as meaning, freedom, responsibility, and mortality. Rather than focusing solely on symptoms, 
					existential therapy helps clients confront the deeper issues of existence, guiding them to live more authentically and align their lives with their values.
					<br>
					<br>	
					In this form of therapy, clients are encouraged to take ownership of their choices and embrace personal freedom, 
					while also acknowledging the uncertainties and challenges of life. 
					By reflecting on their existence, clients can discover purpose and make meaningful decisions that improve their sense of fulfillment and well-being.
					<br>
					<br>
					Existential therapy is particularly effective for individuals struggling with anxiety, depression, life transitions, or a lack of direction. 
					It empowers clients to face life’s uncertainties with courage and create meaning in their own lives.
