							After years of searching I finally found a counsellor who took the time to understand
							me and
							help me navigate through life's challenges.
							Natalie restored hope, peace & joy back to my life. She really is a phenomenal
							counsellor
							who makes you feel so relaxed in her presence,
							listens without judgement and ends up becoming your biggest cheerleader. I honestly
							don't
							know where I'd be without her priceless support.

							Having never tried therapy before, I was skeptical. Natalie put me completely at
							ease.
							She has such an easy manner and has the ability to make you feel heard and understood
							without
							judgement.
							Her unassuming nature helped me to arrive at my own conclusions under her guidance
							and her
							strategies enabled us to come up with intelligent options for change.
							I really could not recommend her enough to anyone seeking therapy.

							Natalie is exceptionally talented, passionate and patient.
							That was my first time in therapy, and I wasn't sure what to expect or say.
							We clicked right away as her approach and questioning techniques have helped me
							progress.
							I always felt safe, seen, and free to disclose anything. She genuinely listened, and
							I could tell she wanted to help me overcome my challenges more than I did. That gave
							me hope, inspired me, and greatly aided me in better understanding and articulating
							myself.
							Have faith and trust in her process. I am so grateful to her!"

							After a number of years out of therapy and a little bump in the road I was recommended
							by a friend to contact Natalie.
							I'm so glad I did, I only wish I had made the connection sooner!
							The hours I have spent working with Natalie on past and current challenges have been
							so valuable!
							She has not only helped me understand my 'why?' but has also been able to educate me
							on how to manage things differently going forward.
							Natalie is like a breath of fresh air! A skillful & empathic professional.
							My experience with her has made me feel free & empowered!

							If you are thinking about talking to a therapist, I would encourage you to go for it!
							Thank you again Natalie for your time & beautiful energy.
