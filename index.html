							After years of searching I finally found a counsellor who took the time to understand me and
							help me navigate through life's challenges.
							Natalie restored hope, peace & joy back to my life. She really is a phenomenal counsellor
							who makes you feel so relaxed in her presence,
							listens without judgement and ends up becoming your biggest cheerleader. I honestly don't
							know where I'd be without her priceless support.

						Having never tried therapy before, I was sceptical. Natalie put me completely at ease.
						She has such an easy manner and has the ability to make you feel heard and understood without
						judgement.
						Her unassuming nature helped me to arrive at my own conclusions under her guidance and her
						strategies enabled us to come up with intelligent options for change.
						I really could not recommend her enough to anyone seeking therapy.

							Initially I was apprehensive about seeking therapy as I have always struggled with sharing
							details of my life with anyone
							and the thought of doing this with a complete stranger was daunting.
							When I started therapy with Natalie, she recognised my reluctance to go beyond the surface
							level aspects of my life - the day to day -
							and as our sessions progressed she gently challenged this part of me. This was important as
							I began to face the core of some deep-rooted pain.
							Natalie was alongside me through it all, creating a space without judgement where I could be
							free to speak honestly, and it was through her gentle,
							attentive manner and skill at being able to link things I had said weeks or months before
							that supported me to
							process particularly difficult events in my life and have a deeper understanding of myself.
							Natalie's ability to hear what is said, and all of what is unsaid, and make sense of it all,
							even when it's not clearly articulated is a skill to behold. She has helped me reframe how I
							see myself,
							which has naturally impacted the way others see me. Therapy with Natalie has opened up my
							life in a way that I never thought possible.
							I will be forever grateful to her.
