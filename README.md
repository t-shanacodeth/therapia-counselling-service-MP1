## Introduction
---
This website was created for Milestone Project 1 of the Code Institute course, Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

### Purpose

Therapia Counselling Service is an online therapy service for individuals seeking a safe space to be vulnerable and talk through their mental health challenges and issues surrounding their lives.
