## Introduction


This website was created for Milestone Project 1 of the Code Institute course, Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

The website is a reimagined version of my therapist's website for her counselling service, [Therapia Counselling Service](https://www.therapiacounsellingservice.com/) (created with her permission).

### Purpose

Therapia Counselling Service is an online therapy service for individuals seeking a safe space to be vulnerable and talk through their mental health challenges and issues surrounding their lives.

The site can be accessed via this [link](...).
