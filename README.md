## User Experience (UX)

### Color Scheme

The color scheme was chosen to be calming and inviting for prospective clients.

<img src="documentation/color-scheme/therapia-color-scheme.png" width="50%">

- **#FFFFFF:** White was used so that the cream color was not overused.
- **#FDF5E6:** Cream color was used as the main color of the website. This was the fist color selected. I wanted to create a calming and homey feel to the website. The other colors were selected to compliment this color and theme.
- **#DE5D83:** Blush pink color to stand out against the rest of the color scheme so that users could easily see the        back-to-top button and the hover action in the footer.
- **##C15071:** Darker pink color used for hover effect over the back-to-top button for clear interaction.
- **#C79A97:** 
- **#B47555:**
- **#CCD8C0:** Pastel green color used for sections of the website - the client stories testimonial boxes and the background of the 'Services' page.
- **#D9BFD9:** Lilac color used for used for sections of the website as it is my therapist's favorite color. I wanted to incoporate more of the colors that she liked or I felt matched her vibe/energy so that the website could best represent her.
- **#252422:** Black color used for the overall text of the website for good contrast between the background and the text.
