## Introduction

This website was created for Milestone Project 1 of the Code Institute course, Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development.

The website is a reimagined version of my therapist's website for her counselling service, [Therapia Counselling Service](https://www.therapiacounsellingservice.com/), and was created with her permission.

### Purpose

Therapia Counselling Service is an online therapy service for individuals seeking a safe space to be vulnerable and talk through their mental health challenges and issues surrounding their lives.

The deployed site can be accessed via this [link here](https://t-shanacodeth.github.io/therapia-counselling-service-MP1/).

Positioned at the top of the page, containing: the company logo on the left side, and the navigation links on the right.
It is clear and easy to understand.

The navigation links have a hover effect so that the users know they are interactive and can be clicked.

The navigation bar is responsive, and the view is the same for tablets and mobiles for ease.
A hamburger menu has been implemented, and when clicked a sidebar opens which reveals the navigation links for users.

## User Experience (UX)

### Color Scheme

The color scheme was chosen to be calming and inviting for prospective clients. It was intended to feel welcomning.

<img src="documentation/color-scheme/therapia-color-scheme.png" width="50%">

- **#FFFFFF:** White was used so that the cream color was not overused.
- **#FDF5E6:** Cream color was used as the main color of the website. This was the fist color selected. I wanted to create a calming and homey feel to the website. The other colors were selected to compliment this color and theme.
- **#DE5D83:** Blush pink color to stand out against the rest of the color scheme so that users could easily see the back-to-top button and the hover action in the footer.
- **##C15071:** Darker pink color used for hover effect over the back-to-top button for clear interaction.
- **#C79A97:** Dusty pink color used as a complimentary color. It was used for some of the sections such as the 'Life Changing Benefits of Therapy' and the 'Response' page.
- **#B47555:** Brown color was used to provide a contrast with the main cream color of the website. It was assigned to the buttons and the heading of the About section.
- **#CCD8C0:** Pastel green color used for sections of the website - the client stories testimonial boxes and the background of the 'Services' page.
- **#D9BFD9:** Lilac color used for used for sections of the website as it is my therapist's favorite color. I wanted to incoporate more of the colors that she liked or I felt matched her vibe/energy so that the website could best represent her.
- **#252422:** Black color used for the overall text of the website for good contrast between the background and the text.

### Typography

The fonts used were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- Abril Fatface was used for the h1 tags on each page. It was used to attract the users' attention.

- Montserrat was used as the main font for the website to provide a contrast with the fancy serif fonts used for the headings and quotes. It increaded the readabilty of the content for the users.

<img src="documentation/fonts/montserrat-googlefont.png" width="35%">

- EB Garamond was used as the font for the subheadings on the home page and the names of the quotes authors.
